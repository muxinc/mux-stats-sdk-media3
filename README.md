Mux Data SDK for AndroidX Media3

# Development Functionality

This SDK is still under development. It has basic functionality (start/end views, pause/playing/seeking/buffering/rebuffering, device/player/view metadata) but it is not production-ready. The test app can demonstrate functionality and be used to test further additions, but this SDK is not finished.
